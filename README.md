# SmartHouse

This is a basic Andriod App that works with Google Firebase to control a miniature smart house. 
It controls various features, and displays outputs from sensors in the house. 

This project was done for our senior design class (EET450/452) at Farmingdale State College. 

Please note, this is NOT the entire project, as I have NOT included our hardware/sensor information, as well as our database tree setup.

This code is my own original code, and it is my first Andriod app. 
Please be kind if you comment, as I am new to this!
